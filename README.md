# Phase10Counter
Small App to keep track of your Phase10 game! Optimised for Phones and Tablets.

# Phase10Counter_Fdroid.apk vs Phase10Counter.apk
The only difference is, the Fdroid version does not have an integrated update checker and there does not have internet permission. The not Fdroid version requires internet only for the update checking.

Or get the latest APK from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/etwasmitbaum/Phase10Counter/releases/latest).

# Important
This was programmed as a side project. I am not any kind of professional developer or IT guy. This was just fun for me.
The Source Code is half english half german and probably contains several war crimes since I did not put more effort into that, than it needed to fulfill the purpose of tracking a Phase10 game.

# Big thanks
